# Image Steganography

## Description
**Image Steganography** is a project that demonstrates the technique of hiding information within image files. This method allows for secure data transmission by embedding secret messages into images without noticeably altering their appearance. The project aims to provide a practical implementation of steganography techniques using various algorithms.

## Features
- **Hide Text in Image**: Embeds textual messages into image files using steganographic methods.
- **Extract Hidden Text**: Retrieves hidden messages from images.
- **Support for Multiple Image Formats**: Compatible with common image formats such as PNG and BMP.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Optionally encrypts and decrypts messages for added security.

## How It Works
The application uses the **Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm** for hiding and retrieving text messages within images. The LSB algorithm works by modifying the least significant bits of the image pixels, which introduces minimal changes to the imageâ€™s appearance.

1. **Hiding Messages**:
   - Convert the message to binary format.
   - Replace the least significant bits of the image pixels with the message bits.
   - Save the modified image with the hidden message.

2. **Extracting Messages**:
   - Read the least significant bits of the image pixels.
   - Reconstruct the hidden message from the extracted bits.
